Scrum supports DevOps by encouraging teamwork,fast feedback and continuous improvement.By working in short sptrints teams are used to testing and releasing work frequently,which is exactly what DevOps mostly promotes.Review and Retrospective scrum events create regular feedback loops,helping teams to learn and improve their processes over time.The clear roles in scrum also reduce silos,encouraging developers and others to collaborate closely together instead of working separately.So overall,scrum creates a structured and flexible environment that makes it easier to adopt DevOps practices and focusing on delivering real value.
